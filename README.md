The course emphasizes how to design A/B tests using prior "guestimates" of effect sizes (often you have these from prior campaigns, or somebody claims an effect size and it is merely your job to confirm it) using Bayesian tools.

The solution is coded in R and Nina Zumel has contributed an updated Shiny user interface demonstrating the technique.

This sort of fills out our survey of ways to think about A/B testing:


 * Classic frequentist theory: emphasizes correct decision over expected returns/value. http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/05/a-clear-picture-of-power-and-significance-in-ab-tests/
 * Bandit Formulations: great utility theory based solution to the problem. http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/04/bandit-formulations-for-ab-tests-some-intuition/
 * Dynamic programming methods: more involved tracking of utility. http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/07/dynamic-prog-ab-test-design/
 * Sequential analysis: operationalizing many of the above ideas. http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/12/sequential-analysis/
 * Bayesian methods: correct distribution inference for individual test runs. (this course/playlist).
